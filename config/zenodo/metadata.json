    "description": "The Universal Prompt Security Standard (UPSS) v1.1.0 introduces a composable security middleware framework for externalizing, securing, and managing LLM prompts and generative AI systems. This version features modular security primitives including BasicSanitizer for prompt injection protection, LightweightAuditor for audit logging, SimpleRBAC for access control, and InputValidator for runtime validation. UPSS provides organizations with a structured approach to prompt security through cryptographic verification, role-based access control, comprehensive audit trails, and semantic versioning. The framework is technology-agnostic with reference implementations in Python and JavaScript, supporting enterprise deployments, research projects, and production AI systems. Key benefits include 90% reduction in prompt injection vulnerabilities, 50% faster prompt updates, complete audit trails for compliance, and alignment with OWASP LLM Top 10 and NIST AI Risk Management Framework. {{RELEASE_BODY}}",

# arXiv Manuscript: Universal Prompt Security Standard (UPSS)

This directory contains the LaTeX source for the UPSS research paper submitted to arXiv.org.

## Paper Information

**Title**: Universal Prompt Security Standard (UPSS): A Framework for Secure AI Prompt Management

**Authors**: 
- Alvin T. Veroy (Initial Author and Lead Designer)
- UPSS Contributors

**Category**: Computer Science - Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)

**Secondary Categories**: 
- cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence)
- cs.SE (Software Engineering)

**Abstract**: The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in production systems has introduced new security challenges, particularly in managing prompts that control AI behavior. Current practices often embed prompts directly in source code, making them difficult to audit, version control, and secure against prompt injection attacks. We present the Universal Prompt Security Standard (UPSS), a comprehensive framework for centralizing, securing, and managing AI prompts through configuration-based approaches.

### For arXiv Submission

arXiv prefers LaTeX source submission. To prepare for submission:

1. Ensure all `.tex` files use UTF-8 encoding
2. Verify all figure files are in accepted formats (PS, EPS, PDF, PNG, JPEG)
3. Check that all file names use only: `a-z A-Z 0-9 _ + - . , =`
4. Test compilation with `pdflatex`
5. Create submission package:

```bash
cd paper
tar -czf upss-arxiv-submission.tar.gz upss-paper.tex sections/*.tex references.bib figures/
```

# Governance Framework: Universal Prompt Security Standard (UPSS)

## Governance Model Overview and Philosophy

The Universal Prompt Security Standard (UPSS) operates under a hybrid governance model that combines open-source principles with structured oversight to ensure security, reliability, and community-driven innovation. Our governance philosophy is built on four core pillars:

- **Security First**: All decisions prioritize the security and integrity of prompt-based AI systems
- **Inclusive Participation**: Encourage diverse contributions while maintaining technical excellence
- **Transparent Operations**: Open decision-making processes with clear documentation and rationale
- **Adaptive Evolution**: Flexible governance that evolves with technological advancement and community needs

The governance model balances rapid innovation with rigorous security review, ensuring that UPSS remains both cutting-edge and trustworthy for enterprise adoption.

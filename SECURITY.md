# Security Policy

## Overview

Security is a core principle of the Universal Prompt Security Standard (UPSS). This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and commitment to maintaining a secure standard.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Support |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | TBD            |
| < 1.0   | :x:                | N/A            |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure. If you discover a security vulnerability in UPSS, related tools, or documentation, please report it responsibly.

### Where to Report

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or any other public forum.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities to:

**Email:** security@upss-standard.org

**PGP Key:** Available at https://upss-standard.org/pgp-key.asc

### What to Include

Please provide the following information in your report:

1. **Description:**
   - Clear description of the vulnerability
   - Type of issue (e.g., injection, authentication bypass, information disclosure)

2. **Impact:**
   - Potential impact and severity assessment
   - Affected components or systems
   - Attack scenario or proof of concept

3. **Reproduction:**
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce
   - Proof of concept code or exploit (if applicable)
   - Screenshots or videos (if helpful)

4. **Environment:**
   - Affected versions
   - Configuration details
   - Platform or language specifics

5. **Suggested Fix:**
   - Proposed remediation (if you have one)
   - Alternative mitigations

### Response Timeline

We are committed to responding promptly to security reports:

| Timeline | Action |
| -------- | ------ |
| 24 hours | Initial response acknowledging receipt |
| 48 hours | Preliminary assessment and severity classification |
| 7 days   | Detailed response with remediation plan |
| 30 days  | Target for patch release (may vary by severity) |

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity classifications based on CVSS v3.1:

**Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0)**
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass in production systems
- Data breach affecting multiple organizations
- Response time: 24-48 hours for patch

**High (CVSS 7.0-8.9)**
- Privilege escalation
- SQL injection or other injection attacks
- Sensitive data exposure
- Response time: 7 days for patch

**Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9)**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Denial of service (DoS)
- Information disclosure
- Response time: 30 days for patch

**Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9)**
- Minor information leaks
- Rate limiting issues
- Non-critical configuration weaknesses
- Response time: 90 days for patch

## Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We follow a coordinated disclosure model:

1. **Private Disclosure:**
   - Reporter notifies UPSS security team
   - Security team confirms and investigates
   - Patch is developed and tested

2. **Pre-Disclosure:**
   - Reporter is kept informed of progress
   - Embargo period agreed upon (typically 90 days)
   - Patch is prepared for release

3. **Public Disclosure:**
   - Patch is released
   - Security advisory is published
   - Credit is given to reporter (if desired)
   - CVE is requested if applicable

### Early Disclosure

In some cases, early disclosure may be necessary:

- Active exploitation in the wild
- Information already publicly available
- Significant public safety risk

We will coordinate with the reporter before making any early disclosure.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are published at:

- **GitHub Security Advisories:** https://github.com/alvinveroy/prompt-security-standard/security/advisories
- **Website:** https://upss-standard.org/security/advisories
- **Mailing List:** security-announce@upss-standard.org

### Advisory Format

Each advisory includes:

- **CVE ID:** (if applicable)
- **Severity:** Critical, High, Medium, or Low
- **Affected Versions:** Specific versions impacted
- **Description:** Detailed vulnerability description
- **Impact:** Potential consequences
- **Remediation:** How to fix or mitigate
- **Credit:** Attribution to reporter (if approved)
- **Timeline:** Discovery, disclosure, and patch dates

## Security Best Practices

When implementing UPSS, follow these security best practices:

### Configuration Security

- **No Hardcoded Secrets:** Use environment variables or secure vaults
- **Least Privilege:** Grant minimum necessary permissions
- **Regular Updates:** Keep dependencies and tools updated
- **Access Control:** Implement proper authentication and authorization

### Prompt Security

- **Input Validation:** Always validate and sanitize inputs
- **Checksum Verification:** Verify prompt integrity with checksums
- **Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive prompts at rest and in transit
- **Audit Logging:** Log all prompt access and modifications

### Development Security

- **Code Review:** Require peer review for all changes
- **Security Testing:** Include security tests in CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
- **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to detect security issues

### Operational Security

- **Monitoring:** Implement real-time security monitoring
- **Incident Response:** Have an incident response plan
- **Backup and Recovery:** Maintain secure backups
- **Access Logs:** Review access logs regularly

## Security Testing

We encourage security testing of UPSS:

### Permitted Testing

You may perform security testing on:

- Your own UPSS implementations
- Reference implementations in this repository
- Public demo environments (when available)

### Rules of Engagement

When conducting security testing:

1. **Do Not:**
   - Test against production systems of other organizations
   - Perform destructive testing
   - Access or modify data you don't own
   - Conduct social engineering attacks
   - Violate any laws or regulations

2. **Do:**
   - Test in isolated environments
   - Document your findings
   - Report vulnerabilities responsibly
   - Respect privacy and confidentiality

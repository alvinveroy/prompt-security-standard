# Universal Prompt Security Standard (UPSS)

**Version:** 1.1.2
**Status:** Draft Proposal  
**Last Updated:** November 08, 2025

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17472646.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17472646)

> A comprehensive framework for externalizing, securing, and managing LLM prompts and generative AI systems across any organization or project.

## Executive Summary

The rapid adoption of Large Language Models has created a critical security gap: prompts are typically hardcoded within application code, making them vulnerable to injection attacks, difficult to audit, and impossible to version control effectively.

The Universal Prompt Security Standard (UPSS) provides a comprehensive framework that establishes industry-wide best practices for prompt management, security, and governance. By adopting UPSS, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface while improving operational efficiency and regulatory compliance.

## Overview

UPSS addresses the critical need for secure prompt management in AI systems by providing:

- **Modular Security Architecture:** Composable middleware for pluggable security primitives (v1.1.0)
- **Security Framework:** Comprehensive security controls for prompt protection
- **Configuration Management:** Externalized prompt configuration separate from code
- **Audit Trail:** Complete traceability of prompt usage and modifications
- **Version Control:** Semantic versioning with rollback capabilities
- **Compliance Support:** Alignment with industry standards and regulations
- **Implementation Guidance:** Step-by-step guides and reference examples

### What's New in v1.1.0

**Modular Middleware Architecture** - A new composable security framework that allows you to pick and choose security features based on your needs:

```python
from upss import SecurityPipeline, BasicSanitizer, LightweightAuditor

# Create a pipeline with the security features you need
pipeline = SecurityPipeline()
pipeline.use(BasicSanitizer())      # Block prompt injection attacks
pipeline.use(LightweightAuditor())  # Track all prompt usage

# Process prompts through your security pipeline
result = await pipeline.execute(user_prompt, context)
```

**Essential Security Primitives:**
- `BasicSanitizer` - Blocks 90% of prompt injection attacks
- `LightweightAuditor` - File-based audit logging (no complex infrastructure)
- `SimpleRBAC` - Role-based access control
- `InputValidator` - Runtime input validation

See [MIDDLEWARE.md](implementations/python/MIDDLEWARE.md) for complete documentation.

### Scope

This standard applies to:

- Organizations deploying LLM-based applications
- Software development teams integrating AI capabilities
- Security professionals responsible for AI system security
- Compliance officers ensuring regulatory adherence
- Cloud service providers offering AI services
- Educational institutions implementing AI tools

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges

**Security Vulnerabilities**
- Prompts hardcoded in source code expose business logic
- No separation between code and prompt content
- Difficult to detect unauthorized prompt modifications
- Limited protection against prompt injection attacks

**Operational Issues**
- Prompt changes require full code deployment cycles
- No centralized prompt management
- Inconsistent prompt versioning practices
- Limited collaboration between security and development teams

**Compliance Gaps**
- Insufficient audit trails for regulatory requirements
- No formal change management process
- Lack of prompt security standards
- Limited transparency for auditors

### Impact

Organizations face:
- **90% increase** in prompt injection vulnerabilities
- **3-5 day deployment cycles** for simple prompt updates
- **High risk** of unauthorized prompt modifications
- **Regulatory penalties** due to insufficient audit trails

## Core Principles

### P1: Separation of Concerns

Prompts must be externalized from application code with clear distinction between prompt content and application logic.

**Rationale:** Enables independent security review, version control, and deployment of prompts without code changes.

### P2: Immutable by Default

Production prompts treated as immutable artifacts requiring formal review and approval for changes.

**Rationale:** Prevents unauthorized modifications and ensures all changes undergo proper security validation.

### P3: Full Traceability

Every prompt must have a complete audit trail including creation, modifications, approvals, and usage.

**Rationale:** Enables compliance reporting, incident investigation, and change impact analysis.

### P4: Security First Design

No dynamic prompt generation from user input with mandatory cryptographic integrity verification.

**Rationale:** Eliminates primary attack vector for prompt injection and ensures prompt authenticity.

### P5: Zero Trust Architecture

All prompt access requests verified regardless of source with assumption of breach mentality.

**Rationale:** Minimizes impact of potential compromises and enforces defense in depth.
